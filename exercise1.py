# Exercise 1-1
# What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?
# a) Execute all of the computation and logic of the program
# b) Retrieve web pages over the Internet
# c) (answer) Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle
# d) Take input from the user

# Exercise 1-2
# What is a program? 
# A set of instructions that specifies a computation.

# Exercise 1-3
# What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
# A compiler translates a program written in a high-level language into a low-level language all at once, in preparation for later execution, and a interpreter executes a program in a high-level language by translating it one line at a time.

# Exercise 1-4
# Which of the following contains “machine code”?
# a) The Python interpreter
# b) The keyboard
# c) (answer) Python source file
# d) A word processing document

# Exercise 1-5
# What is wrong with the following code:
# >>> primt 'Hello world!'
# File "<stdin>", line 1
#   primt 'Hello world!'
#                      ^
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax
# >>>

# Test
# primt 'Hello world!'

# The error that occurs is a syntax error "primt" was used when it should be "print"

# Exercise 1-6
# Where in the computer is a variable such as “x” stored after the following Python line finishes?
# x = 123
# a) Central processing unit
# b) (answer) Main Memory
# c) Secondary Memory
# d) Input Devices
# e) Output Devices

# Exercise 1-7
# What will the following program print out:
x = 43
x = x - 1
print(x)
# a) 43
# b) (answer) 42
# c) x + 1
# d) Error because x = x + 1 is not possible mathematically

# Exercise 1-8
#  Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability: (1) Central processing unit, (2) Main Memory, (3) Secondary Memory, (4) Input Device, and (5) Output Device. For example, “What is the human equivalent to a Central Processing Unit”?

# CPU - Heart of the computer
# Main memory - Short term memory
# Secondary Memory - Long term memory
# Input Device - eating or drinking for your body
# Output Device - ears for listening, eyes for seeing
